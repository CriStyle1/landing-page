# landing-page

In this project I am going to design a landing page, it is part of my Odin Foundation course.
I am goin to reflect all the skills that I learned so far in CSS and HTML.
Like HTML elements, List, Images and so.
CSS rules and properties, The Box Model and working with Flexbox.
By the end the result should be a landing page that looks similar to the one in the picture.
